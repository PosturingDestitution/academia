CHAPTER 1 / COMPUTER SYSTEM OVERVIEW

	"An OS exploits the hardware resources of one or more processor to provide a set of services to system users. The OS also manages secondary memory and I/O devices on behalf of its users."

Basic Elements:
	CPU: PC, IR, execution unit, MAR (address in memory for the next read or write), MBR (the data to be written into memory or which receives the data read from memory), I/O AR, I/O BR
	I/O: buffers
	Main memory: instructions ... data
	system bus

Microprocessor ("The hardware revolution that brought about desktop and handhelp computing was the invention of the microprocessor.")
	- A microprocessor is a single integrated circuit (IC) that contains the core functions of a computer's CPU, which includes processing data, performating arithmetic and logical operations, and controlling data flow within the system.
	- A microprocessor has one processing unit and can perform task in a sequential manner.
	- It handles one thread or process at a time. It is suitable for tasks requiring lower levels of computation or where only one process needs to be run at a time.
	- Microprocessors are commonly used in PCs, embedded systems, smartphones, and other devices requiring a single processing unit for most applications.

	"Not only have microprocessors become the fastest general purpose processors available, they are now multiprocessors; each chip (called a socket) contains multiple processors (called cores), each with multiple levels or large memory caches, and multiple logical processors sharing the execution units of each core."

Multiprocessor
	- A multiprocessor system refers to a computer system that has more than one processor (CPU). These processors work together to handle tasks more efficiently, improving the performance of the system by executing multiple processes simultaneously.
	- A multiprocessor system can include multiple microprocessors or other types of processor wotking in parallel. These processors may share memory or have their own dedicated memory.
	- Since multiple processors can handle different tasks at the same time (parallel processing), multiprocessors can perform complex or multiple taks more quickly compared to a single processor.
	- Multiprocessor systems are commonly found in high=performance compputers, servers, workstations, supercomputers, and systems that require significant computationsal power or need to handle many tasks concurrently.

	"Although processors provide very good performance for most forms of computing, there is increasing demand for numerical computation. GPUs provide efficient computation on arrays of data using Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) techniques pioneered in supercomputers."
	"GPUs are no longer used just for rendering advanced graphics, but they are also used for general numerical processing, such as physics simulations for games or computations on large spreadsheets. Simultaneously, the CPUs themselves are gaining the capability or operating on arrays of data-with increasingly powerful vector units integrated into the processor architecture of the x86 and AMD64 families."

"Digital Signal Processors (DSPs) are also present, for dealing with streaming signals-such as audio or video. DSPs used to be embedded in I/O devices, like modems, but they are now becoming first-class computational devices, especially in handhelds. Other specialized computational devices (fixed function units) co-exist with the CPU to support other standard computation, such as encoding/decoding speech and video (codecs) , or providing support for encryption and security."
"To satisfy the equirements of handhelds devices, the classic microprocessor is giving way to the System on a Chip (SoC), where not just the CPUs and caches are on the same chip, but also many of the other components of the system, such as DSPs, GPUs, I/O devices (such as radios and codecs), and main memory."

Instruction Execution
	"A program to be executed by a processor consists of a set of instructions stored in memory. In its simplest form, instruction processing consists of two steps: The processor reads (fetches) instructions from memory one at a time and executes each instruction. Program execution consists of repeating the process of instruction fetch and instruction execution. Instruction execution may involve several operations and depends on the nature of the instruction."
	"The processing required for a single instruction is called and instruction cycle...the two steps are referred to as the fetch stage and the execute stage."
	"Program execution halts only if the processor is turned off, some sort of unrecoverable error occurs, or a program instruction that halts the processor is encountered."
	
	1. processor fetches an instruction from memory (typically the PC reg. holds the address of the next instruction to be fetched. unless told otherwise the processor always increments this register after the instruction fetch.
	2. the fetched instruction is loaded into the IR reg. the instruction will contain bits that specif the action the processor is to take.
	3. the processor interprets the instruction and performs the required action. In general, these actions fall into four categories:
		- processor-memory: 
		- processor-I/O:
		- data processing:
		- control:
	4.
