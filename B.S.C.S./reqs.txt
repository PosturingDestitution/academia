UARK College of Engineering B.S.C.S

https://engineering.uark.edu/electrical-engineering-computer-science/undergraduate.php

questions:
	what clubs are offered?

	what is the fastest route to graduation? courses over winter/spring/summer?

	am i able to test out of first year mathematics entirely (derivative and integral calculus) or am i only able to test into first year mathematics?

	how many units do i need for the B.S.C.S.?
		(30 + 28 + 30 + 31) = 119 so why does that ^ website say 122? 

	how many courses will i actually enjoy?
		there are 40 courses and 22 of them actually seem relavant to maths/cs so college has to just be one big socializing/networking event
