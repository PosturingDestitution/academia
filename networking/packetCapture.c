/*
why would you capture packets on the network?
 
Packet capture is like listening to the heartbeat of the network.
It reveals both the health of the system and potential threats lurking in the dark.

A network is like a living organism, constantly sending signals, exchanging information, and defending itself from external threats.

When a network admin captures packets, they're not just collecting data â€”
They're peering into the raw bloodstream of the internet.

A TCP SYN packet could be a legitimate client requesting a connection,
or a part of a stealthy port scan from an attacker.
A DNS query could be a user visiting Google,
or malware contacting its command-and-control server (C2).
An ICMP echo request (ping) could be basic connectivity testing,
or a slow, undetectable DDoS attack.

Because everything on the network leaves a trace.
Attackers try to hide, but their packets betray them.
Malware tries to tunnel out, but you catch its DNS requests.
Insiders try to exfiltrate data, but you see the unusual spike in traffic.

You don't just see the network.
You feel the flow of packets.

They can hide their IP, They can spoof MAC addresses, They can even encrypt traffic...But packets don't lie
