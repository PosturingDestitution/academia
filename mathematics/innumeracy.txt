1988 Innumeracy: Mathematical illiteracy and its Consequences - John Allen Paulos
"Innumeracy, an inability to deal comfortably with the fundamental notions of number and chance, plagues for too many otherwise knowledgeable cirizens."

real world examples: stock scams, choice of a spouse, newspaper psychics, diet and medical claims, the risk of terrorism, astrology, sports records, elections, sex discriminiation, UFOs, insurance and law, psychoanalysis, parapsychology, lotteries, and drug testing

A recent study by Drs. Kronlund and Phillips of the University of Wasshington showed that most doctors' assessments of the risks of various operations, procedures, and medications (even in their own specialties) were way off the mark, often by several orders of magnitude.

SCIENTIFIC NOTATION
10^n = 1 followed by n zeros	
	10^4 = 10,000
	10^-4 = 0.0001

	7.39842 * 10^10 is more comprehensible and legible than seventy-tree billion nine hundred and eighty-four million and two hundred thousand
	1,000,000 seconds /60/60/24 = 11.574 days
	1,000,000,000 seconds /60/60/24 = 11,574 days /365 = 31 years

its a good idea to have common collections of items going up the powers of ten maybe to 10^15
estimating quantities is a good exercise

	ex. how long would it take dump trucks to cart away an isolated mountain, say Japan's Mount Fuji, to ground level? Assume trucks come every fifteen minutes, twenty-four hours a day, are instantaneously filled with mountain dirt and rock, and leave without getting in each other's way.

MULTIPLICATION PRINCIPLE
	if some choice can be made in M different ways and some subsequent choice can be made in N different ways, then there are M x N different ways these choices can be made in succession
	from a menu with four appetizers, seven entrees, and three desserts, a diner can design 4 x 7 x 3 = 83 different dinners, assuming he orders each course

	number of outcomes of rolling three dice: 6 x 6 x 6
	number of outcomes in which the number on the three dice differ: 6 x 5 x 4

	how many ways to arrange 8 world leaders in a photo? 8 x 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 40,320
	in how many of these would president reagan and prime minister thatcher (place them into a bag) be standing next to each other? 
		these seven entities (6 remaining leaders and the bag of two) can be lined up in 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 5,040 
		but we can pick how to arrange the 2 leaders so 10,080


TRIPLE-SCOOP CONES AND VON NEUMANN'S TRICK
	Baskin-Robbins ice-cream parlors advertise thirty-one different flavors of ice cream. The number of possible triple-scoop cones without any repetition of flavors is therefore 31 x 30 x 29 = 26,970
	If we're not interested in how the flavors are arranged (order) on the cone but merely in how many three-flavored cones there are, we divide 26,970 by 6 (3 x 2 x 1)  because the first flavor could go in any of the three spots and so on... we get to 4,495 cones.

	How many ways to chose 6 numbers from 40? 40 x 39 x 38 x 37 x 36 x 35 (order matters) = 2,763,633,600 if order does not matter divide by (6! = 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x  = 720)
