what are probability distributions?
	discrete
		bernoulli
		binomial
		poisson: models the number of events occurring in a fixed interval 
	continuous
		uniform: every value in a range has equal probability
		normal: bell-shaped curve, common for modeling natural variations
		exponential
		log-normal
		pareto

how is traffic distributed over time?

poisson distribution
	models the number of events (e.g., packets, requests) happening in a fixed interval of time or space. its often used to model rare events that occur independently of each other.
	if you are measuring the number of HTTP requests arriving at a server in a fixed time interval, the number of requests could follow a poisson distribution if requests arrive independently of each other at a constant average rate.


exponential distribution


log-normal distribution


pareto distribution


gaussian distribution


self-similar and long-range dependent traffic
