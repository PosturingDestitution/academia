routing algorithms:
	distance vector
	enhanced distance vector
	link-state
	path vector

static routes:
	directly attatched
	recurisve
	fully specified
	floating
	routes to Null interfaces

policy based routing: allows routers to make decisions based on other characteristic other than destination IP

virtual routing and forwarding

EIGRP: 
	successor route: the route with the lowest path metric to reach a destination
	successor: the first next-hop router for the successor route
	feasible distance: the metric value for the lowest-metric path to reach a destination. this is calculated locally
	reported distance: the distance reported by a router to reach a destination. the reported distance value is the feasible distance for the advertising router
	feasibility condition: a condition under which, for a route to be considered a backup route, the reported distance received for that route must be lese than the feasible distance calculated locally. this logic guarantees a loop-free path
	feasible successor: a route that satisfies the feasibility condition and is maintained as a backup route. the feasibility condition ensures that the bakup route is loop free

EIGRP packet types

EIGRP metric formulae
	NOTE: a common misconception is that K values directly apply to a bandwidth, load, delay, or reliability; this is not accurate...for example both k_1 and k_2 both reference bandwidth
	wide metrics (address the issue of scalability with higher-capacity interfacs)
