TCP fields
	src port (16 bits)
	dest port (16 bits)
	ack number (32 bits): identifies the position of the data segment in the stream of data segments already sent
	header length (4 bits): indicates the length of the TCP header in 32-bit words, ensuring the header is a multiple of 32 bits
	reserved (6 bits): reserved for future use and is always set to zero
	flags (6 bits): URG, ACK, PSH, RST, SYN, FIN
	window size (16 bits): how many bytes the sender can issue to a receiver while acknowledgment for this segment is outstanding
	checksum (16 bits): allows the receiving node to determine whether the TCP segment became corrupted during transmission
	urgent pointer (16 bits): a location in the data field where urgent data resides, valid only if the URG flag is set
	options (<=320 bits): for special options, such as the maximum segment size a network can handle
	padding: filler information to ensure that the size of the TCP header is a multiple of 32 bits
	data: data originally sent by the source node, with a size that depends on the data to be transmitted and network constraints

1. connection establishment
	1. SYN packet
	2. SYN,ACK packet	
	3. ACK packet

2. data transmission
	1. sender: breaks data into segments and sends them over the network
	2. receiver: receives segments and reassembles the original data
	3. acknolegment: receiver sends an ACK packet to acknowlege receipt of each segment

3. flow control
	1. window size: the maximum amount of data that can be sent before an ACK is required
	2. advertised window: the receiver advertises its current window size to the sender

4. termination (the conneciton remains in a closed state until both devices agree to close it)
	1. FIN
	2. ACK
	3. FIN
	4. ACK
