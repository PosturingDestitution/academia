1. introduces the notion of secure encryption, from weak pen-and-paper ciphers to strong, randomized encryption
2. describes how a pseudorandom generator works, what it takes for one to be secure, and how to use one securely
3. discusses theoretical and practical notions of security, and compares provable security with probable security

plaintext: refers to the unencrypted message
ciphertext: encrypted message
cipher: composed of two functions (encryption and decryption) we will write this relation as C = E(K, P) and P = D(K, C)


NOTE: ciphertexts can never be shorter than plaintexts

classical ciphers are ciphers that predate computers and therefore work on letters rather than on bits
	caesar cipher
		caesar >>>3 fdhvdu
	vigenere cipher
		theydrinkthetea >>>3, >>>20, >>>7, ... wblbxylhrwblwyh

based on simplistic ciphers like the caesar and vigenere ciphers, we can try to abstract out the workings of a cipher, first by identifying its two main components: a permutation and a mode of operation.
