basic structs
basic enums
stack/heap memory

1. fundamentals
	- some sort of record manager	
	- dynamic vector (mini std::vector)	
	- config file parser

2. more serious, mimics OS internals
	- process table simulator (store in an array, linked list, or priority queue)
	- job scheduler simulator (FCFS, round robin, priority scheduling)

3. OS-adjacent projects
	- memory allocator (malloc clone)
	- basic file system emulator
	- cooperative multitasking simulator

4. alignment
	- memory dump + struct analyzer
	- hardware packet format parser
