Encryption uses an algorithm called a cipher and a secret value called the key; if you do not know the secret key, you cannot decrypt, nor can you learn any bit of information on the encrypted message and neither can any attacker.

plaintext: refers to the unencrypted messages
ciphertext: refers to the encrypted messages

"A cipher is therefore composed of two functions: encryption...and decryption...but we will often say 'cipher' when we actually mean encryption"
C = E(K, P)
D = E(K, C)

NOTE: for some ciphers, the ciphertext is the same size as the plaintext; for some others, the ciphertext is slightly longer. however, ciphertext can never be shorted than plaintexts.
