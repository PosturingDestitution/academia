i dont want to graduate in 2096...what can i do?

what information do i need? what are my school accounts? what information is provided to me?

when would i graduate if i did not take classes over breaks and did not test out of classes?

when could i graduate if i did take as many classes as possible over breaks and tested out of first year mathematics?

what classes can i test out of other than mathematics?

should i test out or just pad my GPA forever?
